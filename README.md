# Time Calculator

The provided code includes a function called "add_time" that performs time calculations and tracks the day of the week.

The "add_time" function takes a start time, a duration, and an optional starting day as inputs. It calculates the end time by adding the duration to the start time. The start and end times are represented in a 12-hour format with AM or PM.

The function handles various cases, such as parsing the start time and duration, performing hour and minute calculations, and formatting the end time. It also tracks the day of the week if a starting day is provided.

Example usages demonstrate how to use the "add_time" function to calculate the end time in different scenarios, including cases where the duration spans across multiple days. The outputs include the end time and, if applicable, the updated day and the number of days elapsed.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to calculate and track time, making it useful for tasks such as scheduling and event management.
